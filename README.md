## About

Adaptive Wrapper Maintenance implements approaches for maintaining adaptive wrappers in an MWA system. The codebase focuses on research and prototype implementations and includes documentation in TeX for papers or technical notes.

## Features

- Core maintenance and adaptation algorithms implemented in JavaScript
- Supporting documentation and notes in TeX
- Examples and helper scripts for testing or prototyping

## Languages

- JavaScript: 91.1%
- TeX: 8.9%

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn
